# Screen Time vs. Real-Time Social Activities  

## Project Proposal  

### Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between screen time and time spent on real-life social activities.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Increased screen time is negatively correlated with time spent on real-life social activities.
  
### Motivation  
In today's digital age, people spend a significant portion of their time on screens, which may impact their participation in real-time social activities. This project aims to analyze the relationship between screen time and social engagement to identify patterns and potential behavioral insights.  

### Data Source  
The data for this project will be collected through:  
1. **Screen Time Data**: Tracked using built-in phone usage logs.
2. **Social Activities Data**: Derived from Google Maps Timeline, represented through position ping counts.


### Data Collection Plan  
- **Screen time**: Daily phone usage logs (hours spent on different apps, total screen time).  
- **Social activities**: Inferred from Google Timeline data through position pings (high ping counts suggest more time spent outside or in social contexts).
- **Additional factors**: Historical daily weather conditions were included as a proxy for environmental influences.

### Analysis Plan  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns.
- Conduct **statistical tests** to examine correlations between screen time and social activities.  
- Use **visualization techniques** to represent the findings effectively.  
- Apply **machine learning models** to predict social engagement based on screen time usage.  

### Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, scikit-learn
- **Data Storage**: CSV files, Excel spreadsheets

### Conclusion
- This project supports the hypothesis that increased screen time is moderately associated with decreased social activity, with weather conditions also playing a role. The findings highlight how personal screen usage may interact with environmental and behavioral factors, offering insights into tech-life balance in modern routines.
