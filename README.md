# Screen Time vs. Real-Time Social Activities  

## Project Proposal  

### Hypothesis
- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between screen time and time spent on real-life social activities.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Increased screen time is negatively correlated with time spent on real-life social activities.
  
### Motivation  
In today's digital age, people spend a significant portion of their time on screens, which may impact their participation in real-time social activities. This project aims to analyze the relationship between screen time and social engagement to identify patterns and potential behavioral insights.  

### Data Source  
The data for this project will be collected through:  
1. **Screen Time Data**: Tracked using built-in phone usage logs, and Steam API for the time spent in video games (Mine).
2. **Social Activities Data**: Mainly, logged manually based on daily participation in social events or interactions, and also from Google Maps.  


### Data Collection Plan  
- **Screen time**: Daily phone usage logs (hours spent on different apps, total screen time), my own Steam gameplay hours data will be collected by Steam API.  
- **Social activities**: Self-reported logs, including time spent with friends, family, or at events, and Timeline from Google Maps. 
- **Additional factors**: Sleep duration (tracked daily) and weather conditions (sourced from local weather data) will also be considered, as both can influence screen time and participation in real-life social activities.

### Analysis Plan  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and patterns.  
- Conduct **statistical tests** to examine correlations between screen time and social activities.  
- Use **visualization techniques** to represent the findings effectively.  
- Apply **machine learning models** to predict social engagement based on screen time usage.  

### Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Storage**: CSV files / Google Sheets
